## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

- this repo contains the code for the landing page.
- You can use the range slider to change the value of Pageviews.
- On the top right corner there is one moon icon on tapping on that you can change the theme of the webpage.
- I have used CSS, HTML AND JAVASCRIPT for this project
- for building this project I had taken the help of websites like [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp), [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).

## What I learned by finishing this project.
how to use svg and how to use the range slider and storing the value of that via a JavaScript.

## Continued developement.
I had learned how to use the range sliders but still I am having issues with that so I will be brushing up on that further in the future.
